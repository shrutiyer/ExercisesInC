### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1) Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of
the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that
is not literally true about the implementation?

Ans. When I transfer money from one bank account to another bank account, I
should see the money in the other account with just a click of a button.       
Abstractly, it seems like a simple money deducted from one bank gets transfered
directly to the other bank (with some delay). But, in reality, there is request
for the money transfer that needs to be sorted by the Automated Clearing House
(ACH) that processes the request and transfers the money to the other account
all abstracted out from the customer.

Ans. A program is a set of instructions whereas a process is the program in
action.

5) What is the kernel?
